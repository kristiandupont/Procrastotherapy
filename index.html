            Productivity is a word I use a lot and sometimes it feels a bit sad.
            I live in Barcelona where long lunches with wine are common. Life is
            not all about work and it shouldn't be, so why am I so obsessed with
            productivity?
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the time I work for myself, without a boss of any kind. This
            is very enjoyable but I've found that I sometimes spend entire days
            without accomplishing anything. Not because I &ldquo;take the day
            off&rdquo; but rather because I just waste the time while trying to
            make myself work.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            My productivity is highly correlated to my happiness
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I think of myself as a creative person, in the sense that creating
            things gives me pleasure. I subscribe to a broad definition of
            creativity here&mdash;I am attracted to arts of all kinds but I also
            consider the process of starting a company to be creative. And I
            find that my productivity is highly correlated to my happiness. The
            more I've accomplished in a day, the happier I seem to be. This is
            obviously not the only factor, but it seems to me to be an important
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to accomplish as much as possible in as little time as
            possible. I want to optimize the output of the time that I
            <i>do</i> spend working. Which I feel is quite a lot, sun and
            alcohol aside. So it's frustrating to me when I spend a day working
            but without having anything to show for it. In those cases, I would
            rather have spent it outside!

            This site is a curated collection of research and techniques. It
            reflects my personal journey in this field, which is far from over.
            Links are provided to these resources and unless otherwise stated,
            they are ones I have read or used, and that I recommend. This site
            is about what works for me. For instance, I have tried meditating
            numerous times without noticing any effect even though countless
            people (including some that I respect greatly) say that it helps
            them a lot. I haven't personally experimented with nootropics, even
            though I find the concept interesting. Thus, there is no information
            about these topics here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procrastination, I find, is something you have to battle constantly,
            and on three different levels, both psychologically and in terms of
            the time frame they cover. There are different techniques to apply
            to each level. I'll go over them top-down.

            <a href="https://www.neilfiore.com/now-habit/"> The Now Habit</a> by
            Neil Fiore explores how the cause of procrastination is often fear.
            Fear of failure, fear of criticism, or even fear of success. If you
            are a perfectionist, you might be associating your accomplishments
            with your self-worth in an unhealthy way. Procrastination is a way
            for your ego to defend your sense of value. Procrastination doesn't
            necessarily mean spending all your time on YouTube, it can just as
            well mean that you are actually working on a project, only you spend
            your time doing more research or perfecting details indefinitely.
            These are safe activities because your work (and thus, your ego) is
            protected from exposure to the outside world. <br />
            With this perspective, it becomes clear that punishing yourself for
            laziness and simply trying harder or spending more time isn't the
            solution. The book describes a number of techniques that you can
            apply to overcome this fear, but the biggest impact it had on me was
            simply realizing that this connection exists. You can start with

            Life is short and engaging in a project or developing a skill takes
            a lot of time
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Neil Fiore seems to conclude that fear is the sole reason why people
            procrastinate. I don't think that is the case. My personal page
            links to many creative endeavors of mine that are nowhere near what
            I would like them to be, but they are out there, visible to the
            world. Unless I am oblivious to some really deep and hidden issues
            in my own psyche, I often procrastinate simply because my brain
            decides that a task is not (currently) important enough to bother
            with.
            <br />
            There is one fear I do struggle with from time to time though. In
            order to be productive, you need to make decisions. You may not be
            the goal setting type, but you still need to know what you want to
            be working on, and actually deciding to work on something is the
            first step. This sounds trivially obvious but in my personal
            experience, this can be problematic. I would like to do many, many
            things. Travel the world, create products and companies, run
            marathons, paint, write, compose&mdash;the list goes on. Annoyingly,
            I am so presumptuous that I believe that I could do any of these
            things, though not enough to believe that I can do <i>all</i> of
            them. Life is short and engaging in a project or developing a skill
            takes a lot of time, much of it spent in

            as described by Ira Glass. This leads me to second-guessing of my
            priorities, sometimes driving me into paralysis by analysis.

            Should you set goals? Many gurus say so, to the point where it seems
            a truism. But there are exceptions. Leo Babauta is not a fan. He
            feels that by creating goals you try to force your life in one
            direction while it might actually be better for you to go in
            another. Read his reasoning in
            <a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/" target="_blank"
              >this article</a
            >. Others say that you can set goals as long as they are actionable
            (i.e. &ldquo;make a million&rdquo; is not a proper goal because it's
            not something you can decide to do whereas &ldquo;cold call 10
            people every day for the next month&rdquo; is). From this
            perspective, I do set goals though I consider them to be more
            related to my task list than to some life vision.

            Once you have made a commitment, your focus should only be on the
            execution. For this, it's essential that you understand how
            willpower works. It's not just a workaholic trait that you and I
            happen to lack. It's a resource that we have in varying degrees at
            various times. The concept of
            <i>decision fatigue</i>, coined by Dr. Roy Baumeister, is key here.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Deciding to quit your job is a decision, but so is deciding if you
            want to make breakfast at home or go to a caf&eacute;
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The theory says that you have a limited supply of cognitive
            resources on any given day. Making a decision depletes this supply,
            as do things like resisting sugary foods. Deciding to quit your job
            is a decision, but so is deciding if you want to make breakfast at
            home or go to a caf&eacute;. One is very important in your life and
            the other will have no consequences tomorrow. Yet they rely on the
            same, limited resource. He has a couple of books on the subject
            which I have yet to read, but
            <a
              href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?_r=0"

            gives a good introduction. <br />
            With this in mind, it's clear that you need to guard your willpower
            capacity fiercely. How to do that most efficiently? Consistency and
            habits.

            When something is part of your routine, you don't have to waste your
            cognitive resources on it to the same degree. If you decide to work
            on something once and then do that day in and day out, without
            regard to your motivation and energy on the particular day, you
            remove the need to make the decision every day. Also, the constant
            effort compounds and can produce surprisingly great results. Two
            famous takes on this idea are
            <i>the 20 mile march</i> and <i>don't break the chain</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 20 mile march is described by Jim Collins and Morten T Hansen in
            their book
            <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/books/great-by-choice.html">
              Great by Choice</a
            >. The key here is to decide to do a specific amount of work daily.
            Some times it will feel exhausting and some times you will feel like
            you could easily do more and in both cases, the key is that you do
            exactly the amount of work you set out to do. This, it turns out,
            tends to give better results than scaling your effort with your
            daily motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Don't break the chain</i> is a technique that was attributed to
            Jerry Seinfeld though apparently that was just a myth. It's still an
            interesting take on the idea though, you can read about it in
            <a

            >. You put a calendar on your wall that shows the entire year. You
            start doing something, in this case write a joke, every day. Every
            time you've done that, you cross that day in the calendar. After a

            I find that the two previous techniques work well for one thing at a
            time, so use them for whatever is currently the primary task in your
            life (and remember, if you have more than one top priority, you have
            <i>no</i> top priorities). For the secondary stuff, you need to
            create habits. Habits are great because they too are easy on the
            willpower account.

            Since habits are such an intrinsic part of our lives, it's easy to
            think that you understand them well and that there is no reason to
            study the subject. Don't fall into that trap. Habit formation is a
            field of interesting research that explains a lot about why we do
            what we do. Creating new habits and getting rid of bad habits is
            difficult, but can be made easier by knowing the mechanics. Habits
            rely on cues and rewards that turn into cravings. When making
            changes to your habits, try to limit yourself to changing one at a
            time. It turns out that if you decide to change a bunch of habits
            simultaneously, you are less likely to succeed. If you are removing
            a habit, you are going to suffer from cravings so you need to
            replace it with something else.

            Even with consistency and habits, external distractions can still be
            very costly for you.

          <blockquote>

            you to focus on other things
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This cost can be minimized by creating a system that captures
            incoming distractions of all sorts. Getting Things Done, or GTD, is
            such a system. It was created by David Allen and is described in his
            book
            <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>.
            The basic insight is that an unresolved task will stay in the back
            of your mind and not allow you to focus on other things. The way to
            remedy this problem is to have a place where you "store" tasks for
            later. In order for this to work, you need to feel confident that
            you will in fact be reminded of the task when necessary. Inbox Zero
            is a GTD-like methodology applied to email which is one of the
            biggest sources of distractions to people like me. You might want to
            start there. You can get an introduction to it in Merlin Mann's talk
            at Google in
            <a

              >this video</a
            >. <br />
            There are many, many tools and software products that assist with
            GTD. I personally use the unsophisticated system of gmail and text
            files, so I won't make any recommendations.

            You also want to look out for your environment. During a meeting in
            a fancy hotel I discovered that I tend to think &ldquo;bigger&rdquo;
            when in luxurious surroundings. Likewise, I find it easier to stay
            focused when surrounded by people who are working. When I am in a
            situation where my environment changes a lot, it helps me to create
            a virtual environment by putting on my noise cancelling head phones
            and going to

            and how managers might negatively affect makers' productivity with
            interruptions. Managers, he says, have lots of meetings and don't
            consider another meeting to be a distraction as long as their
            calendar has the empty slot. To makers however, it can be greatly
            disruptive to a day's work to have a meeting in the middle.

            I'm going to assume that you don't spend all of your time managing
            because procrastination tends to be less of a problem there. When
            you have a meeting, you basically go to it, you don't say
            &ldquo;I'll do that tomorrow.&rdquo; As a maker (or person spending
            the day in &ldquo;maker mode&rdquo;), the optimal way to perform
            tasks is by reaching the state of
            <i>flow</i>. This term was coined by Mih&aacute;ly
            Cs&iacute;kszentmih&aacute;lyi who has done extensive research in
            this area. Flow is the state of mind where you focus completely on
            the task at hand and lose your sense of time and place. A number of
            conditions need to be met for this to happen. You need to be working
            on something where you feel confident in your skills, and the work
            needs to be sufficiently challenging to match those skills. If you
            want the details of this, read his book

            One way that I find helps me achieve flow is timeboxing my tasks.
            This simply means setting a timer to a certain number of minutes and
            committing to working during that time. After the timebox ends, you
            are allowed a break where you can check Facebook or get coffee.
            There are a couple of reasons why this works well. Firstly, it
            forces you to divide and conquer: you can only set out to do a
            moderately sized task in 15 minutes. So if the task at hand is too
            big for that, you need to break it down. Secondly, it's easier to
            avoid distractions when you know that you are allowed a reward in a
            few minutes. This keeps you focused during the timebox.
            <br />
            John Cleese tells about using timeboxing for creativity in
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g"
              target="_blank"
              >this excellent talk</a
            >. The most famous timebox system is probably
            <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank"
              >The Pomodoro&reg; Technique</a
            >
            by Francesco Cirillo. Pomodoros are 25 minute intervals with 5
            minute breaks and 15 minute breaks for every 4th pomodoro. <br />
            GTD also uses the concept of a timebox for quick tasks: if something
            can be done in two minutes or less, you should set aside those two
            minutes and complete the task right away. <br />
            Francesco Cirillo prefers a tangible device over software because
            the manual process of rewinding the timer is a sort of commitment. I
            find that for me personally, software works just fine.

            I used to think that the timeboxes were the finest level of
            granularity necessary. But alas, my brain will pull any trick to
            avoid working. Even in a 15 minute timebox, my mind will some times
            start to wander. To combat this, I started giving myself micro
            rewards, a variation of the

              >Magic Dots</a
            >
            idea by Dr Seth Roberts. He has a timer that notifies him every 6
            minutes.

          <blockquote>
            the weird thing is that it actually does feel like a little reward

          <p>
            When this happens, he draws a dot or a line in a simple pattern. His
            repeats the same pattern consisting of 10 dots and lines, which
            makes one pattern and takes an hour to make.
            <br />
            The micro reward reminds you not to drift, and the weird thing is
            that it actually does feel like a little reward. It's hard to relate
            to until you try it. When I discussed this with my friend Thomas
            Blomseth, he decided not to do repeatable patterns but instead
            create pieces of art by simply adding a dot to his drawing every
            time. I've been doing this myself for a while now, at 5 minute
            intervals. It works well because my timeboxes are typically
            divisible by five minutes, 15 minutes, a pomodoro (25 minutes) or 45
            minutes. As a reward, you end up with pieces of art. I am currently
            keeping different pieces for different projects.
